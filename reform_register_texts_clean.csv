I understand that Disclosable Pecuniary Interests include not only my interests but also the interests of my spouse or civil partner, a person with whom I am living as husband and wife, or a person with whom I am living as if we were civil partners, so far as I am aware of the interests of that person. 7. The Localism Act 2011 has created specific criminal offences in relation to the disclosure of Disclosable Pecuniary Interests (Part A of this form).  I understand that I commit an offence if, without reasonable excuse, I: (a) fail to register a Disclosable Pecuniary Interest within 28 days of my election, re-election or appointment to office; (b) fail to disclose at a meeting of the Council the nature and existence of a Disclosable Pecuniary Interest unless I have disclosed the interest to the Monitoring Officer, who has agreed that the interest amounts to a sensitive interest; (c) fail to notify the Monitoring Officer of a Disclosable Pecuniary Interest that I have disclosed at a meeting of the Council within 28 days of the date I made the disclosure; (d) continue to deal with a matter in which I have a Disclosable Pecuniary Interest (other than for the purpose of enabling the matter to be dealt with otherwise than by me) without being granted a dispensation; (e) provide information that is false or misleading in respect of any notification of my interests and I know that that information is false or misleading, or I am reckless as to whether the information is true and not misleading. 8. Any allegation that I have committed an offence relating to the notification and disclosure of my interests may be investigated by the police and referred to the Director of Public Prosecutions.  Upon conviction, I understand that I am liable to a fine not exceeding level 5 (currently £5000) on the standard scale and that I may be disqualified for up to 5 years from being or becoming a member or co-opted member of any authority. 9. If I feel I have an interest which, if disclosed on a public register, could lead to me or a person connected with me being subject to violence or intimidation, I will disclose this as a sensitive interest to the Monitoring Officer and seek their approval for this information to remain confidential.

became a councillor because I’ve spent my life serving others
– from my time in the army to running my own business and
volunteering in the community. I’ve seen first hand how local
people are being let down by those in power and I felt it was time
to stand up and be a voice for real change. I
care deeply about the issues that matter – over development,
antisocial behaviour, poor transport links, lack of support for
pensioners. My
priorities as your councillor are simple, to listen, act and put
residents first. I believe in common sense policies, local
accountability and standing up for the people of Alphington and
Cowick.
